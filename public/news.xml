            <title>India & China skip renewable pledge, 118 nations sign</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[ India and China abstained from a pledge taken by 118 nations at UN climate summit (COP28) to increase global renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency by 2030. India, focused on economic growth and poverty reduction, maintains the leeway to use coal until 2030. India remains committed to increasing its non-fossil power capacity, but cannot make commitments that hinder development. India's stand can be negotiated later, as it is already part of the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration. ]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[ Chief Justice of India emphasizes the importance of dissenters and challenges to prevailing majoritarian views in society. Dissent nourishes democracy and a society will fail and not progress if dissent is suppressed. The State must support the weaker population, whether numerical or social minority, and allow them to have a say in the decision-making process. Dissents, even if unpopular and unacceptable, have the power to spark important conversations and fundamentally restructure society. ]]>

            <title>Why and how you can have multiple UPI IDs on Google Pay</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[ This article discusses the concept of Smart Routing in UPI transactions. Smart Routing is a feature that improves the success rate of payments by routing transactions through different UPI IDs associated with a user's bank account. It acts as alternative routes to avoid payment failures. Users can have up to four UPI IDs for the same bank account. The process of creating additional UPI IDs can be done through the Google Pay app. Having extra UPI IDs doesn't change the transaction process, but provides alternative routes in case of unavailable payment routes. Logging out of Google Pay deactivates bank accounts, requiring reactivation upon logging back in. ]]>
