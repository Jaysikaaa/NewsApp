Smart Routing is a feature that improves the success rate of payments by routing transactions through different UPI IDs associated with a user's bank account. It acts as alternative routes to avoid payment failures. Users can have up to four UPI IDs for the same bank account. The process of creating additional UPI IDs can be done through the Google Pay app. Having extra UPI IDs doesn't change the transaction process, but provides alternative routes in case of unavailable payment routes. Logging out of Google Pay deactivates bank accounts, requiring reactivation upon logging back in. "
