High – Level write up on your approach

The News Article project is structured as a React application with the following components:

•	App  Component:
Manages the state for search, page, and the fetched news articles.
Passes down search, page, and news articles as props to child components.
•	Search Component: 
Renders an input field to search for news articles.
Updates the search state in the App component based on user input.
•	Pagination Component:
Renders buttons for "Prev" and "Next" to navigate through pages.
Updates the page state in the App component.
•	NewsArticleList Component:
Receives news articles as props and renders the list of articles.
Each article item contains a button triggering a ContextMenu component.
•	ContextMenu Component:
Renders the context menu with "Edit" and "Delete" options.
On selection, triggers an alert with the corresponding action and article ID

Assumptions in the Solution

•	Mock data is used for news articles generation, real API is not called.
•	Search and pagination are on front-end side.
•	The context menu in the ContextMenu component triggers an alert for Edit or Delete purposes. In a real application, we would perform relevant actions based on user selections
